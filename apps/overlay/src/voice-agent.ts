// GamePoint voice agent — local-only TTS output + closed-vocabulary, push-to-talk STT input.
// WP-6 (docs/governance/contract-audit-v1.2.md). Governed by ADR-010.
//
// Hard invariants this module must never violate:
//  - No background/passive listening: recognition only runs while the caller holds it open
//    (start() ... stop()), never on a timer or wake-word.
//  - No persistence: voice consent lives in OverlayState.voice (in-memory, state.ts), never in
//    PersistedSettings (the only slice written to localStorage).
//  - No wire-contract change: recognized intents map onto the existing HotkeyIntent enum
//    already carried by AssistRequest. audio_opus_bytes stays z.null() always — raw audio never
//    leaves this module; only a matched intent (or nothing, on no-match) does.
//  - No new cloud vendor by default: TTS uses window.speechSynthesis (OS voices via the
//    WebView2/Chromium engine). STT uses the browser SpeechRecognition API, feature-flagged off
//    (ENABLE_VOICE_INPUT) until verified local-only on real Windows hardware — see ADR-010.
